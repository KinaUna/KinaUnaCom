# KinaUnaCom

The source code for KinaUna.com

KinaUna is an ASP.Net Core 2.2 web application, hosted on Azure.

The goal is to create apps, services and tools for families.

Basically the idea is to take features from business, lifestyle and social networking software and adapt them to private family tools.

As it has been a one-person project so far, the features are limited to some basic functions for managing and sharing a child's information, with room for plenty of improvements:
Photos, Videos, Calendar, Locations, Vocabulary, Skills, Friends, Measurements, Sleep, Notes, Contacts, and Vaccinations.

It features a simple timeline and notifications as well.
Localization has been implemented and most pages are available in English, German and Danish.

A lot of refactoring is still needed to make the code cleaner, but the foundation is there to fairly easily add more functions and features.
So, more will come soon, along with more documentation.
